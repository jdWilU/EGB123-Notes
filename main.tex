	\section{Unit Introduction}
	\subsection{Unit Motivation}
	\textit{Engineers have the task of creating, maintaining and extending the physical infrastructure that allows society to function. This infrastructure has developed over many generations, in response to the needs and demands of society, and has become more complex over time. \textbf{Planning} and \textbf{design} are the key activities that are used, together with management, to bring projects through to successful completion.}
	
	\dfn{Unit Overview}{This unit introduces the knowledge and skills used to undertake site investigations and project assessments as part of infrastructure planning and management activities to meet stakeholders' needs.}

	\subsection{Assessment Overview}
	The units assessments will consist of the following:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assessment 1: \textbf{Study Area Investigation} - You will work in a group of four:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item to investigate functions of a real world engineering system at an urban study area. 
			\item with co/leadership of sub tasks preassigned to specific members with contribution by all other members.
			\item 15\% individual across two sub tasks, 15\% group (30\% total)
			\item \textbf{Submission:} Group submits, each individual submits a text response on own contribution (Same Due Date).
		\end{itemize}
		\item Assessment 2: \textbf{Major Project Assessment} - Work in a group of four:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prepare a major project assessment that reviews and analyses prescribed technical aspects of two real world major civil engineering projects.
			\item 20\% individual across two sub tasks, 15\% group (35\% total)
			\item \textbf{Submission:} Group submits, each individual submits a text response on own contribution (Same Due Date).
		\end{itemize}
		\item Assessment 3: \textbf{Final Exam} - Individual (35\%).
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Urban Study Area Investigation}
	You will be provided a study area investigation brief that contains backgrounds as well as directions on how to conduct investigation. Will work in a group of 4 to complete:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item 4 items in Sub Task A (Each led by one group member)
		\item 2 items in Sub Task B (Co led by two group members)
		\item 1 Technical report in Sub Task C (All group members contribute).
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Investigation}
	The project will involve three sub tasks:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Topography and Water Utilities}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Topography
			\item Stormwater
			\item Sewer
			\item Water Reticulation
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Bridge Approaches and Bridge Structure}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bridge Approaches and Abutments
			\item Bridge Structure
		\end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Engineering Technical Report}
	\end{enumerate}

	For each item in sub task A, the item will ask you to 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item explain the typology of the system with definitions and roles of components. 
		\item Locate certain features on spatial layer documents.
		\item Annotate responses to queries on spatial layer documents.
		\item Interpret the system under investigation and discuss how that system relates to street layout, build form, ease of movement.
	\end{itemize}

	For sub task B, you will be asked to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{B1} Consider bridge approaches and abutments, and how they relate to the street layout and build form. This will be done using six tables, each containing a series of stated forms or stated considerations about bridge approaches and abutments.
		\item \textbf{B2} Consider the bridge structure for a real bridge in the study area. 
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Information Sources}
	Throughout the unit, the following sources of information will be used:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spatial information on Community maps, nearmap, google street view. 
		\item Government and agency documentation from Austroads. 
	\end{itemize}
